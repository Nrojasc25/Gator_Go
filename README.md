# Gator Go
Whether you're planning a weekend trip or heading home for the holidays, this program helps you discover which of your friends (or their friends) might be going too â€” making it easy to carpool or just share plans.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
* Users can input a destination city (from their current location) and travel date.

* The system displays a list of friends traveling to the same city within a Â±n (user-input) day window.

* Each match shows the friendâ€™s name and travel date.
  
* If a friend-of-a-friend is also going to the same place in that timeframe, they appear too!

## ðŸŒŸ Future Implementations

* If a friend-of-a-friend is also going to the same place in that timeframe, they appear too â€” along with a note like:
knows 2 other friends. This would be implemented for privacy issues

## ðŸš§ In Progress
This project is currently under development. Stay tuned for interactive features and a clean, visual interface for exploring travel overlaps!

## ðŸŒŸ HOW TO RUN:

* Clone the repository
* Run main.py
* Log-in by inputting username (open dataset from files inside the folder of the repo cloned called "Dataset" and copy one of the respective names)
* Select out of options 1, 2, 3, or 4
* Get carpooling!
